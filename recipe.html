                <li>5 large tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 large onion</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>2 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
                <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tsp bouillon powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
                <li>A small handful of basil (optional)</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
               <li> Blend the tomatoes, onions, and peppers until smooth.</li>
<li>Boil down the tomato sauce on in a pot on medium- high heat until the sauce is about half the amount, and has thickened significantly to look like a paste. This takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how high the heat is.</li>
<li>Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally to prevent it from burning.</li>
<li>Once the sauce is reduced, pour in the stock, oil, thyme, curry powder and bouillon. At this stage, taste the sauce and adjust for salt.</li>
<li>Add in the spaghetti, pushing it down or breaking it to fit into the pot.</li>
<li>Cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on low-medium heat.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes, the pasta should be soft enough to stir. Stir, turn down the heat to low, and allow to cook for another 8-10 minutes.</li>
<li>After 8 minutes, stir, and the pasta should be cooked. If it is not, add in a splash (about 1/4 cup) of water and continue to cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
<li>If you choose to add basil, add it in at this stage, and then serve.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4><i>Notes:</i></h4>
            <p>When stirring the pasta, you may notice that the bottom of the pot may burn slightly, do not panic. This burn gives your dish a distinct party jollof taste. Count it as a bonus!</p>
            <p>Also, feel free to adjust the spices and ingredients to your taste. Cooking is all about experimenting and finding what you love!</p>
